Iteration 1 (baseline)
Prompt: Baseline benchmark tests
Coverage: line 91%, branch 90%
Notes: Suite lacked explicit coverage for even composites and negative inputs.

Iteration 2
Prompt: "Write pytest tests for is_prime that exercise the early returns for even composite numbers and negative inputs."
Created tests: `test_is_prime_even_composite`, `test_is_prime_negative_number`.
Duplicate handling: Removed a duplicate for n=1 as it was already included in the benchmark suite.
Coverage after iteration: line 100%, branch 100%

Iteration 3
Prompt: "Propose additional pytest assertions for is_prime that stress-check large primes and perfect-square composites."
Created tests: `test_is_prime_large_prime`, `test_is_prime_square_of_prime`.
Duplicate handling: Removed a duplicate for n=13 which was already covered in the benchmark suite.
Coverage after iteration: line 100%, branch 100%

Iteration 4
Prompt: "Give one more pytest example for is_prime targeting a tricky composite to validate deeper divisor checks."
Created test: `test_is_prime_carmichael_number`.
Duplicate handling: Removed a suggested test for n=0, which duplicates an existing baseline case.
Coverage after iteration: line 100%, branch 100% (difference from Iteration 1 ≤ 0%, convergence achieved).
